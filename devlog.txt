2:30PM
 - The Dev Log is up-to-date (mostly) with my personal
   notes.

10:30AM
 - I've put a fair amount of time into coding,
   and only a little bit towards the theoretical
   Game Design, or a Game Design Document.

 - I also need to go back and digitally transcribe
   the Dev Log, and Update Log. (DONE)

9/6/19 

12PM
 - The current build is stable. I'm just feeling
   demotivated towards further progress.

11AM
 - FIXED: Fixed yet another display bug.
          It seems stable for now.


8/28/19 

1:20PM
 - FIXED: Apparently the Critter Sod measurement 
          wasn't implemented correctly,
          so I'm fixing that and updating
          the Sod Per Sec Display to account for
          
          The Unemployed Critters.


8/23/19 

3:15PM
 - Laid basework for Farmers, Miners, and Harvesters.

2:30PM
 - IDEA: Look at Critter Mound For Dirt & 
   Sod Conversion to Food.
 - IDEA: Farmer(Sod) / Miner(Dirt) / Harvester(Food)?
 - IDEA: Mound Upgrade @ 5 Critters. Unlock Farming.
   2 Farmers / 1 Harvester / 2 Miners


8/21/19 

4:15PM
 - Updated Display and Introduced basework for Critters.

12:55PM
 - Laid basework for Buy Critter Button.

12:45PM
 - Updated/Improved Displays.

12:30PM
 - Updated GitHub Repositories.
 - Also updated Shovel Display to display 
   Next Shovel Cost.


8/20/19 

2PM

IDEA: Another Idea I had was to add a button/mode for
Auto-Progress, that way I can turn it on, 
let it run in the background,
and reach late-game quickly to test.


8/18/19

NOTE: If I use Sod as the Base Resource, I know I can
use Shovels for Automation.

Then Critters convert Sod to Food, OR produce more Sod.

Now, where do I expand? What about Soldiers/Military?

More Soldiers produce more Willpower. 

Then Will Power can be used to run Militia Campaign,
perhaps similar to Trimps/Critter Mound.

Or maybe Risk/Dice-Based?


8/17/19

IDEA: Tier 1 - Sod & Shovel Production
      Tier 2 - Mound & Critter Production
      Tier 3 - Food & Military Production
      Tier 4 - ???


8/16/19 

10:30AM
- NOTE: I read somewhere that most Idle Games follow
        a certain theme.
        Food, Wood, & Ore are typically 
        the base resources.
        
        My idea is to do Food/Sod/Ore, and Sod be the
        Critter Construction Material.
  
        This way, Critters have a purpose.
        Converts 2 Sod to 1 Food every second.
  
- NOTE: Alternatively, Sod could be the base material,
        and other materials draw from sod, 
        requiring balance, and maintaining 
        Improved Sod Production.


8/14/19

3:45PM
 - TODO: Looking into Porting Button Creation to 
   JavaScript-side.

3:30PM
 - Still no sense of direction atm. 

2:30PM
 - Reverting again.
   W3 Schools has a good guide.


8/13/19 

11:30AM
 - Making Display Update Functions & 
   Moving Them to the top of Main Function.


8/9/19 

3:40PM
 - Update Sod moved successfully.

3:30PM
 - NOTE: var updateDisplay 
(Not sure what this means. 
Retroactively making digital record.)

11:30AM
 - I thik I briefly had it working,
   but it's broken again.
   
   Reverting back a version.

10AM
 - I've finally got Shovel Cost incrementing at a
   preferable rate.

- I'm going to attemt to make a display control object.
  AGAIN.


8/8/19

5:45PM
 - Cleaned up some Display Code. It still seems stable.
 
 - TODO: One thing I need to consider is a 
   static version display in the upper-right corner.
   This way I can leave different version idling,
   and get a better picture of the late-game.

4:50PM
 - NOTE: Still refining Incremental Rates for Upgraded 
   Mound.


4:30PM
 - FIXED: Fixed a display bug with the 
   Shoveled Sod Per Sec.

4pm
 - FIXED: Fixd a bug that I didn't realize existed.
   Involved Mounds not deducting the correct amount
   of Shovels.

3PM
 - Confirmed Fixed. I went back to the tutorial I based
   it on to correct the issue.

1:30PM
 - FIXED: I believe the previous issue is mostly fixed.

11:20AM
 - NOTE: Changed Sod ID in HTML to sodDisplay to avoid 
   future confustion.

11:30AM
 - BUG: Found a bug where Shovel Cost will decrease if 
   youbuy Mound, and then jump exponentially.

10AM
 - It appears that the best option is to go back to 
   the Stable Build.


8/7/19

5:45pm
 - Broke something while fixing/cleaning/moving the 
   display.
   Might have to go back a build, but hoping not.
   
5:20pm
 - NOTE: First Critter costs 50 Sod.
 
4:50pm
 - After some more thought on it, there's no real NEED to 
   condense code yet.
   
 - TODO: However. converting the button code over to the 
   JavaScript-side might be worth considering soon.

 - GOAL: For the time being, the next goal is to 
   implement Critters, via Building The Mound.

 - NOTE: Critters auto-gather 3 Sod Per Sec, 
   while devoted Farmers gather 5 Sod Per Sec.

2:30pm
 - The only sensible way that I can picture doing the 
   Sod Production is as an object centered by the 
   Critter Mound as the main Object.

1:50pm
 - I'm going to work on cleaning the code before adding 
   more functionality.

1:30pm
 - I've got a stable build with decent display functionality.
 - Very messy, but remains mostly functional with minor
   tweaks as I change stuff.
   
 - Right now you can:
   - Click for sod.
   - Buy shovels w/Gradually Increasing Price.
   - Build a Mound that improves overall production.
     This will eventually allow for Critters to be housed.
